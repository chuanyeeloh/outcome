			<ol>
				<li>Identify and categories the different web sites and its functions. </li>
					<p>In the age of technology, there are a lot of website are occurred in the Internet now. There is different function on the different website and the website can be divided into different type of categorises. For example, blogging website, business website and e-commerce website.
					<br>
					First, Blogging website is a type of website that like a personal diaries website. This type of website normally is using by the teenagers especially girls. They always like to share some information or mood on the website so the others blogger can visit the blog and giving some respond. This is also like a type of social networking sites, people can comment on the blog and the blogger can give some responding on the website.
					<br>
					Then, Business brochure or catalogue website is a website that presents the visitors with photos and descriptions of the products but it is different with the E-commerce website, this website cannot sell the product over the internet. Business brochure or catalogue website also engaged in online business professional website, and corporate website.
					<br>
					Next, E-commerce websites is a website that provide visitors for buying or selling the products through the internet. Visitors also can transmit the funds and data on it. It is like a type of online shopping. For example, consumer can through E-commerce website to achieve online shopping and they can pay the payment through electronic payments. This is the convenience of the E-commerce website, it brings a lot of benefit for consumer and save many times and money of them.</p>

				<br>
					<li>Describe the term ‘target audience’.</li>
					<img src="img/img.05.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
						<p>Target audience is the demographic of people who are most likely to show interest in your product or service. They are very important for the business area because they have to make their product being popular for the public. But it is also having some business focus on the target audience like comic company because not everyone like comic especially for the workers or older people.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
					<li>Describe the term ‘house style’.</li>
						<P>House style is to ensure the stylistic consistency in a particular and typically it provides rules. House style is a variation that do not distracting and keeping a consistent style in matters of detail. For example, it manages the things like the colour that should to be used, font style or size, or the position of the logo.</P>
				<br>
				<br>
					<li>Identify and explain the different page layout styles for different web sites.</li>
						<p>A page of layout often use term of like fixed, static, responsive, and others. Each page layout will be different when the page is viewed with a different device. This is because the horizontal width of the browser could be changed and the website is being viewed on different devices like mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and others. If using the viewport on a website, the user no need to resize the browser by follow the different devices because viewport can make the website automatized resize itself. 
						<br>
						Fixed layout commonly regarded as one of least flexible methods of layout’s web design because it is fixed and static and did not have any change for the web design. Next, Elastic layout is the most used methods of laying out a design’s content because it is ability to scale content, text sizes, and such. Moreover, Relative layout is the relative positioning and layouts adjust in size depending on the size of the user’s browser viewport. This layout is bringing a lot of benefit because the layout will scale according to the viewer’s situation. Then, scaled Layout is one of the latest methods in CSS3 allows the manipulation of the available viewport around certain device orientations. This layout is relying on a specific layout type and it can be used limited space being available on handheld mobile devices.

					<li>Describe common development methodologies used by modern project managers and identify its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
					<img src="img/img.06.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
						<p>Software development methodologies is the important part of developing the software. There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages on the software development methodologies.
						<br>		
						The waterfall is one of the most traditional and commonly used by software development methodologies for software development. The advantages of waterfall model are it is very simple and easy to understand. Next, in this water fall phases are processed and completed are at once in a time so it can save a lot of time. The disadvantages of waterfall are once an application is in the testing stage, it is not possible to go back and edit again. More, waterfall is good for a small project but not suitable for a long and huge projects.
						<br>
						The prototype methodology is the software development process which allows developers to create only the prototype of the solution to demonstrate its functionality to the clients and make necessary modifications before developing the actual application. The advantages of prototype methodology are when a prototype is shown to the clients, they get a clear understanding and complete 'feel' of the functionality of the software. The disadvantages of prototype methodology are too much involvement of client is not always favoured by the software developer and too many modifications may not good for the project, as it easily disturbs the workflow of the entire software development team.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
					<li>Propose tools/diagram used to establish well communication during requirement gathering phase.</li>
						<p>
						The tool that can be used to establish well communication during requirement is Git. Git is a tool that can save the codes and upload to a server and the member can pull the data from it for modify the code or increase the information. After a member finished the modify, he will upload again to the server for other member discussing. Next, Git also can let every member to do the adjustment of the codes at every time and it can record the history of date and time on when you doing the adjustment. If the part is already being modify, the others member can see the changing of the code and no need to adjust again. This can save a lot of time on no need rewrite the codes and bringing the benefit to software developer because it is simple and easy to be use.

			<u><h1 id="h1">Outcome 3</h1></u>
				<ol>
				<li>Explain the importance of codes readability. </li>
					<p>Code readability is very important for software developer. This is because if the codes are hard to be read, it will make the process be delay because wasting time on investigate or fix the codes. Making complicated codes are easy but make it easy to be read is hard. It is not only make it hard to be read and also can confusing about it. For example, if they are doing a huge project, it is no time on go back for refactor the projects again. They must to accomplish the projects as soon as possible so the projects can be more efficiency. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Identify the modern coding guides for web pages development. </li>
					<p>Modern coding guides is a type of guide or concept for web pages and it can make programmer be more easy on reading the codes. A readability codes is important because if the codes is difficult to read, it will waste a lot of time on modify the codes. Because of many programmers didn’t want to waste time on reading the difficult codes, they have their own coding guides so that they are not confusing about the codes and the project will not be delay.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Introduce one of your favourites coding guide standard.	</li>
					<p>One of the favourite coding guide standard is tab button. This is because it has same effect by 4 times space in a one tab. This can save a lot of time on coding and the coding become more neatly. Therefore, it can make us be more easy when sort out our codes and be easy to be read. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Introduce the tools used to debug CSS/HTML problems.</li>
					<p>
					Inspect element is best for debugging CSS problems.  It can help software developer to solve the website problems and it is act as a part of the developer tools. This tool can help us to fix the specific element with a simple way which is just right click and select “Inspect element” on the context menu. This will save a lot of time on finding the specific element one by one. Next, Web Developer Extension also is a tool that can solve the CSS problems. It can run on any browsers and it added a toolbar on the browser that can help us to debug or inspect the CSS element. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Explain how version control tools can solve team collaboration problems.</li>
					<p>Version control is a type of software tools that can help a team collaboration to rewrite the codes in every time. For example, the codes of the project typically will save in a folder and if a teammate is creating a new project, so that other teammate can help to find out the bug and fix it. Maybe every teammate will modify the codes but it will make the project be more prefect. Version control can help to solve these problems on tracks every single changes and prevent the conflicting happen. Every single change will be recorded by date and time so that is also has the function of history. This can make the project be more efficient and no need to worry about when the teammate rewrites the codes. Version control can avoid the incompatible of the codes if other teammates are fix the codes at the same time. So, version control can be solved without delay the other teammate’s works. Version control brings a lot of benefit to a team collaboration because it can make a team be more united and cooperated.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Introduce a css framework and describe the benefit of using a css framework.</li>
				<img src="img/img.07.jpg" width="700px" height="400px">
					<p>Framework is a type of layered structure and it is provided codes and if we need the codes, we can just copy from it. This will save a lot of time and no need write from scratch again. Framework can save the step of the coding and it is standardized. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<u><h1>Outcome 4</h1></u>
					<li>Introduce automated testing of HTML / CSS.</li>
						<p>Automated testing is the automating of a process. Automated is used to decrease the error and manual setting.  This can save a lot of time and it is reliable on same operation and avoid the human error. Next, it is reusable because we can reuse again in different version’s application. Besides that, it is fast because automated tools are faster than human manual use.  Automated can save the cost of decrease the number of testing and resources.</p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<li>Explain user-agent.</li>
						<p>   User-agent is a type of string or computer program that can identify browser, operating system or application. It is also act as an application that can remotely accesses through network. User-agent also is a language settings and a permission of a website. We can through user-agent to visit the website of version of relevant program such as media or JavaScript. </p>
					<br>
					<br>
				</ol>
				<ol>
				<u><h1>Outcome 5</h1></u>
					<li>Explain the factors that affect the file size of an image: number of colours, file compression, physical pixel dimensions, file type.</li>
						<p>
						The factor that affect the file size of an image is compression. Compression is the process for reducing the size of a file. It can encode the file and make it become smaller. There are two types of compression which are lossless and lossy. In lossless compression, the date will not be deleted, it just makes the file be smaller. In lossy compression, a bits of data will be lost or deleted because computer think that the data is unnecessary. 
						</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>Describe the advantage of ‘transparency’ when applied to PNG over GIF. </li>
						<p>PNG image with alpha has 256 level of color. Alpha is representing the transparency level of pixel of an image. PNG has three main advantages over GIF which is Alpha channel, color correction and two-dimensional interlacing. It can use 8 bits for change the transparency but not using gif for changing it. This transparency normally can be used on web pages such as change color or fancy color of the text. First, PNG begins on only reading small percentage of the data and inserted the colour to empty spaces until all the data be loaded. GIF can also use this way but the quality of the image in the end is not better than PNG.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>Describe the common methods to optimise images download size and number or requests from web server.</li>
						<p>First, we have to make sure the image that saved is in lossless version. If the image is in .jpg file, we have to test quality and compression setting and make sure the image is in balance and perfect quality when loading the image. If setting the image as background of web pages, we have to use medium or low compression. The important things are we have to make sure the quality and suitable file size of the image. </p>
					<br>
					<br>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<u><h1>Outcome 6</h1></u>
					<li>Describe the behaviours of web server and interaction with browser.</li>
						<p>Behaviours of web server and interaction with browser are web server is like a data base which contain many data inside it and browser is like a website that can connect with web server for get the data from web server. Therefore, it means that the web server and browser has the relationship like cooperation. Browser will connect with web server for searching the information for the visitor of the website. Website is responsible for giving respond to browser and browser is responsible for receive the message from web server.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>Describe the one tool used to deploy/update a web site.</li>
						<p>Tool that used to deploy or update a web site is GitHub. GitHub is a type of version control system and some project can be upload on the GitHub for discussing publicly. It acts as a data base for saving some codes so the user can use it. User can pull request to original author for rewrite some codes that uploaded by the original author at the GitHub.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>Identify how the web sites can be promoted.</li>
						<p>We can promote website the web site by using SEO which is Search Engine Optimization and it is also a type of optimized. SEO is focus on the ranking of the search results and the web site that on the top ranking will be found by SEO. Therefore, the web sites will be visited by many user and every web sites author will try to make their web sites be found by SEO so that their website will be famous.  </p>
